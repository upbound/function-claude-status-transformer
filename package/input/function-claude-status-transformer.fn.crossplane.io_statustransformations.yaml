                      Endpoint is where you can override the default endpoint configuration
                      of AWS calls made by the function.

                      hostnameImmutable:
                        description: |-
                          Specifies if the endpoint's hostname can be modified by the SDK's API
                          client.

                          If the hostname is mutable the SDK API clients may modify any part of
                          the hostname based on the requirements of the API, (e.g. adding, or
                          removing content in the hostname). Such as, Amazon S3 API client
                          prefixing "bucketname" to the hostname, or changing the
                          hostname service name component from "s3." to "s3-accesspoint.dualstack."
                          for the dualstack endpoint of an S3 Accesspoint resource.

                          Care should be taken when providing a custom endpoint for an API. If the
                          endpoint hostname is mutable, and the client cannot modify the endpoint
                          correctly, the operation call will most likely fail, or have undefined
                          behavior.

                          If hostname is immutable, the SDK API clients will not modify the
                          hostname of the URL. This may cause the API client not to function
                          correctly if the API requires the operation specific hostname values
                          to be used by the client.

                          This flag does not modify the API client's behavior if this endpoint
                          will be used instead of Endpoint Discovery, or if the endpoint will be
                          used to perform Endpoint Discovery. That behavior is configured via the
                          API Client's Options.
                          Note that this is effective only for resources that use AWS SDK v2.
